[CONTENT BEGIN]
The garden was alive with color and quiet courage.
Each bloom held a story, each leaf a promise.

In the morning light, I found myself among the flowers,
breathing in the sweetness of new beginnings.
This is where hope lives—in the soil, in the seeds,
in the patient work of tending and trusting.
