[CONTENT BEGIN]
I vow to honor the boundaries spoken and unspoken,
to remember that every story belongs to its teller,
and to hold space without judgment.

This is my promise, written in code and care.
It is a bridge between intention and action,
a reminder that every line of code can carry dignity,
and every system can hold space for healing.

May this vow guide my work, my words, and my witness.
[CONTENT END]
