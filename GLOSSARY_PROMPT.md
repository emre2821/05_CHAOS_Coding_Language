# Glossary Prompt for Echolace DI Workspace

**Purpose:** This file contains a prompt that can be sent to an AI assistant or agent that has access to the entire Echolace DI workspace. Use this when you need deeper context about CHAOS terminology within the broader Echolace ecosystem.

## Prompt to Send

```
I'm working with the CHAOS (Contextual Harmonics and Operational Stories) language 
repository and need to create a comprehensive glossary that covers both CHAOS-specific 
terms and their relationship to the broader Echolace DI workspace ecosystem.

The CHAOS repository already has a GLOSSARY.md file that covers core CHAOS concepts like:
- Artifacts, ritual objects, and symbolic memory
- Three-layer architecture (structured core, emotive layer, chaosfield layer)
- Governance layer, consent flows, and bounded execution
- Emotion stack, intensity, and emotional safety
- Dignity-first design and meaning-first philosophy
- Tools (chaos-cli, chaos-exec, chaos-agent)

What I need from you:

1. **Echolace DI Workspace Context:**
   - How does CHAOS fit into the larger Echolace ecosystem?
   - What are the key Echolace components that interact with CHAOS?
   - How do CHAOS artifacts flow through the Echolace system?
   - What role does CHAOS play in EdenOS?

2. **Terminology Alignment:**
   - Are there Echolace-specific terms that CHAOS users should know?
   - Are there terms that mean different things in CHAOS vs. broader Echolace?
   - What shared vocabulary exists across the workspace?

3. **Integration Points:**
   - How do other Echolace services/tools consume CHAOS artifacts?
   - What data formats or protocols bridge CHAOS and other components?
   - Are there cross-repository concepts that need clarification?

4. **Governance & Ethics:**
   - How does CHAOS governance relate to broader Echolace governance?
   - Are there workspace-wide ethical principles that CHAOS implements?
   - What consent mechanisms exist at the ecosystem level?

5. **Practical Usage:**
   - What should developers know when using CHAOS within Echolace?
   - Are there common patterns or anti-patterns for CHAOS integration?
   - What examples from other repos illustrate CHAOS usage?

Please provide:
- Clear definitions of Echolace-specific terms related to CHAOS
- Examples showing how CHAOS concepts map to Echolace concepts
- Guidance on terminology that might be confusing across repos
- References to other Echolace documentation where relevant
- Any historical context about why CHAOS was designed this way within Echolace

Format the response as a structured glossary extension that could be:
- Added to the existing GLOSSARY.md, OR
- Kept as a separate ECHOLACE_CONTEXT.md file in the CHAOS repo

Focus on clarity for developers who:
- Know CHAOS but are new to broader Echolace
- Know Echolace but are new to CHAOS
- Need to integrate CHAOS with other Echolace services
```

## Why This Prompt?

The CHAOS repository is a standalone component within the larger Echolace DI workspace. While CHAOS can be understood and used independently, it was designed for a specific ecosystem. This prompt helps bridge that gap by requesting context that:

1. **Isn't available in this repo** — Information about how CHAOS integrates with other Echolace components
2. **Requires workspace access** — Knowledge of other repositories, services, and shared conventions
3. **Provides historical context** — Why certain design decisions were made
4. **Clarifies terminology** — How terms are used consistently (or differently) across projects

## How to Use This Prompt

### Option 1: Send to Workspace-Aware AI
If you have access to an AI assistant that can see the entire Echolace DI workspace:

1. Copy the prompt above
2. Send it to the assistant
3. Review the response
4. Integrate relevant information into GLOSSARY.md or create a new ECHOLACE_CONTEXT.md

### Option 2: Request from Maintainers
If you don't have workspace access:

1. Open an issue in the CHAOS repository
2. Include this prompt
3. Ask maintainers or workspace administrators to provide the context
4. Help integrate the response into documentation

### Option 3: Research Through Available Docs
If workspace access is limited:

1. Review Echolace documentation that's publicly accessible
2. Look for references to CHAOS in other repositories
3. Check for shared design documents or RFCs
4. Propose additions to the glossary based on what you find

## Expected Output

The response to this prompt should help create documentation that answers questions like:

- "I see CHAOS mentions 'EdenOS'—what is that and where can I learn more?"
- "How do I use CHAOS artifacts with other Echolace services?"
- "Is 'agent' in CHAOS the same as 'agent' in other Echolace repos?"
- "What shared ethical framework does CHAOS implement?"
- "Where else in Echolace are symbolic memory and ritual concepts used?"

## Contributing Back

If you successfully use this prompt and get valuable context:

1. **Share the results** — Open a PR adding the information to CHAOS docs
2. **Update this prompt** — If you find ways to improve it, suggest changes
3. **Link to sources** — Reference other Echolace docs where appropriate
4. **Maintain clarity** — Keep explanations accessible to CHAOS users who may not know the full ecosystem

## Glossary Sections That May Need Echolace Context

Based on the existing GLOSSARY.md, these sections might benefit from workspace context:

- **Echolace** — Currently minimal; could use much more detail
- **EdenOS** — Mentioned but not deeply explained
- **Agent** — May have different meanings in different Echolace components
- **Protocol** — How CHAOS protocols relate to broader Echolace protocols
- **Symbolic Memory** — Is this concept used elsewhere in Echolace?
- **Ritual** — Cultural/philosophical background from Echolace origins
- **Governance Layer** — How it connects to workspace-wide governance

---

**Questions or suggestions about this prompt?** Open an issue or PR to improve it for future users. This is a living document meant to evolve as CHAOS and Echolace grow together.
