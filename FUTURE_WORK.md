# Future Work

This document outlines potential improvements and extensions for CHAOS that require
human input, architectural decisions, or community discussion before implementation.

## Language Extensions

### Type System Enhancements
- [ ] **Optional Type Annotations** — Allow users to annotate symbols with types
  for static analysis and editor support
- [ ] **Protocol Polymorphism** — Enable user-defined protocols that extend the
  base stabilize/transform/relate patterns

### Syntax Evolution
- [ ] **Multi-file Ritual Linking** — Support importing symbols from other `.sn`
  files for larger narrative structures
- [ ] **Conditional Emotion Blocks** — Allow emotional transitions to trigger
  specific narrative branches

## Agent System

### Memory Persistence
- [ ] **Long-term Symbol Storage** — Implement optional persistence layer for
  agent symbols across sessions
- [ ] **Dream Archive** — Store generated dreams for retrospective analysis

### Protocol Registry
- [ ] **Custom Protocol Definitions** — Allow users to define domain-specific
  protocols (e.g., sales workflows, support escalation)
- [ ] **Protocol Chaining** — Enable sequential protocol execution

## Business Integration

### Data Connectors
- [ ] **CRM Integration** — Optional connectors for Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.
- [ ] **Webhook Notifications** — Push dream summaries and protocol results
- [ ] **Export Formats** — Additional output formats (Markdown, CSV, XML)

### Analytics
- [ ] **Emotion Trending** — Track emotion patterns across multiple scripts
- [ ] **Relationship Mapping Visualization** — Generate graph visualizations

## Developer Experience

### Editor Support
- [ ] **VS Code Extension** — Syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for `.sn` files
- [ ] **LSP Server** — Language Server Protocol implementation for broad editor support

### Testing Tools
- [ ] **Snapshot Testing** — Built-in support for testing expected outputs
- [ ] **Coverage for Narrative Paths** — Track which narrative branches are exercised

## Community & Governance

- [ ] **RFC Process** — Establish a process for proposing language changes
- [ ] **Style Guide** — Document recommended patterns for `.sn` scripts
- [ ] **Example Gallery** — Curated collection of real-world CHAOS scripts
