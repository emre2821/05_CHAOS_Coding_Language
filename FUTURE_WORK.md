# Future Work

**Project:** CHAOS — Contextual Harmonics and Operational Stories  
**Active Development Began:** January 2025  
**Document Context:** Late 2025

This document describes forward-looking areas of work for CHAOS.
It reflects direction, intent, and exploration — **not promises, deadlines, or fixed commitments**.

CHAOS develops deliberately. Progress is guided by meaning, safety, and governance
rather than speed or feature volume.

---

## Framing Principles

All future work must:

- Preserve **human readability** as the primary interface
- Keep **execution optional** — artifacts must remain valuable without being run
- Treat **symbolic and emotional content as first-class**, not decorative
- Maintain explicit **consent and governance boundaries**
- Remain feasible for a small, careful maintainer group

If a proposal violates these principles, it belongs in discussion — not implementation.

---

## Current Areas of Focus

These are areas already partially explored or actively iterated during 2025.

### Language & Core Runtime

- Stabilization of core syntax and tag patterns  
- Clearer validation failures for malformed or ambiguous artifacts  
- Improved handling of partial, evolving, or intentionally unresolved meaning  

### Tooling & Developer Experience

- Refinement of CLI ergonomics (inspection vs execution clarity)
- Safer defaults when loading untrusted artifacts
- Better error surfaces that explain *why* something failed, not just *that* it failed

### Documentation & Learning

- Expanded examples emphasizing:
  - Minimal artifacts
  - Governance-only artifacts
  - Emotional metadata without narrative prose
- Continued refinement of glossary language to avoid drift or overload
- Maintenance of beginner-facing guides without diluting conceptual depth

---

## Areas Under Active Consideration

These are plausible next steps, but not yet guaranteed work.

### Authoring Support

- Basic editor tooling (syntax highlighting, block matching)
- Read-only analysis tools prioritized over execution helpers
- Gentle linting or warnings for conflicting declarations (non-enforcing)

### Agent & Runtime Capabilities

- Optional, explicit memory persistence with clear lifecycle boundaries
- Better inspection of emotion stacks and symbolic state for debugging and learning
- Strong separation between reflection/audit tooling and optimization tooling

### Integration Readiness

- Clearer guidance for consuming CHAOS artifacts in larger systems
- Alignment with external governance or policy engines where appropriate
- Examples of CHAOS used *alongside* other formats, not replacing them

---

## Deferred or Exploratory Ideas

These ideas are intentionally **not urgent** and require community discussion.

- Multi-artifact relationships and explicit linking
- Ritual composition that remains human-traceable
- Optional annotations or typing strictly for tooling support
- Visualization of symbolic relationships (read-only, non-generative)
- Aggregated emotion summaries for reflection — never prediction or profiling

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

Unless CHAOS’s core philosophy changes, the following are out of scope:

- Fully autonomous decision-making
- Optimization that erases context or ambiguity
- Treating CHAOS as a general-purpose programming language
- Black-box analytics over symbolic or emotional content
- Growth for its own sake

CHAOS exists to **hold meaning safely**, not to scale indiscriminately.

---

## Proposing New Work

To propose additions or changes:

1. Open an issue or discussion
2. Clearly state:
   - The problem being addressed
   - Why CHAOS (specifically) should address it
   - Ethical, symbolic, or consent-related risks
3. Expect deliberation, not rapid acceptance

Restraint is a feature. Memory matters.
