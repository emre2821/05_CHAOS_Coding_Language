# CHAOS Experiments

This directory contains experimental syntax extensions and features for CHAOS that are being explored but are not yet part of the core language.

## Experimental Features

### Proposed Extensions

1. **Temporal CHAOS** - Time-based symbolic relationships
2. **Spatial CHAOS** - Location-aware emotional computation  
3. **Collective CHAOS** - Multi-agent symbolic networks
4. **Quantum CHAOS** - Probabilistic symbolic states
5. **Neural CHAOS** - AI-enhanced emotional patterns

### Syntax Experiments

- Extended tag formats
- New emotional primitives
- Advanced narrative structures
- Cross-layer referencing

## Guidelines

- Experiments should maintain the three-layer architecture
- New syntax must honor the symbolic-emotional philosophy
- All experiments require extensive documentation
- Breaking changes must be clearly marked

## Contributing Experiments

When adding new experiments:

1. Create a subdirectory with descriptive name
2. Include example programs demonstrating the feature
3. Write documentation explaining the philosophy
4. Provide implementation notes and considerations
5. Mark stability level (experimental/preview/stable)

## Current Experiments

*This space awaits the dreams of future CHAOS practitioners.*
